# PROGRESS LOG

## April 5, 2025
### Progress
- 

### Learnings
- useEffect and useState are React hooks, effect -> allows you to run code after component has rendered, state -> manages component states between renders 
- functions with const are immutable

## April 4, 2025
### Progress
- added pin card component
- completed base backend function for image fetching from Unsplash

### Learnings
- for apps involving frontend and backend (fetching images) I must run both servers at the same time on two different terminals
- cors allows the two to function together despite running on different servers
- components are so cool! they make things so much easier to organize
- methods are always attached to objects but functions are standalone

## March 25, 2025
### Progress
- set up page navigation logic
- completed styling for navigation bar

### Learnings
- React feels like the perfect mix between html and js, it is super visual and you can see how the page is laid out
- monorepo: when I am storing all of my repos (backend and frontend) as one. it works well for how my brain works but apparently for bigger projects involving multiple people these are separated
- setting up backend: first getting an API access key, storing it in a .env file (and also making sure to list in .gitignore since the key must be secret), setting up index.js to handle fetching, and then handling the rest in frontend
